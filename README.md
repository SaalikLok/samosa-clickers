## Motivation
This project was a fun way for me to play more deeply with React and use GraphQL for the first time. It's also a great side-project to have the side-business I'm running in college.

## The Stack
For this project, I'm using:

* React
* GraphQL
* Sass
* Apollo
* Graph-Cool

## Further Development:
I may end up using this code elsewhere or adding some nice UI polish, but otherwise this project won't be actively maintained.
